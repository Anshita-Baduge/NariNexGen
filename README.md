# NariNexGen - Interactive Financial Learning Platform

## Overview
**NariNexGen** is an interactive web platform designed to empower young adults with financial literacy. The platform bridges the gap between learning and action by allowing users to **learn financial concepts**, **simulate real-life financial decisions**, and **track their progress** with gamified features like streaks and XP progress rings.

This project was developed as a part of a FinTech challenge and is built to provide an engaging, Duolingo-like learning experience for users who want to improve their financial wellness.
